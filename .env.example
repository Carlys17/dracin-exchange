# === Fee Collection ===
# Your wallet address to receive fees from every swap
# Leave empty to disable fee collection
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_COLLECTOR=0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE

# Fee percentage — this is the % taken from each swap output
# Examples:
#   0.05  = 0.05% (recommended, competitive with other aggregators)
#   0.1   = 0.1%
#   0.3   = 0.3%
#   0.5   = 0.5%
#   1.0   = 1.0% (max recommended, higher may lose users)
#
# How it works:
# - Fee is deducted from the OUTPUT token, not input
# - LI.FI and Socket handle the fee split natively via their contracts
# - User sees the post-fee amount in the quote (fully transparent)
# - Fee is sent directly to your NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_COLLECTOR wallet
# - No extra smart contract deployment needed
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEE_PERCENT=0.05
